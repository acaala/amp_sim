# Rustone - A Rust-Based Guitar Amp Simulator

Rustone is a guitar amp simulator written in Rust, offering musicians a versatile platform to shape their guitar tones. This project is inspired by popular amp simulation software like Guitar Rig and Amplitube but is designed with the efficiency and performance benefits of the Rust programming language.
